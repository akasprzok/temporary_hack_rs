The tool consists of a tablet and projector that can be used to create and organize new interactive components for vehicle dashboards. A user can use a freehand sketching interface to draw a new interactive element on the tablet, and a simple set of gestures to motion the created item onto a real dashboard. A simple interface is provided to connect the created components to vehicle data published by an integrated driving simulator. The system is currently a work in progress, and future work will include integration with real vehicle dashboards, autonomous vehicles, and support for participatory design sessions.",
